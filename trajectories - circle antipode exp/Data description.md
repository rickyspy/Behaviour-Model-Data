Base Data description

We have four types of trajectories here. EXP, BM, SFM, VO respectivly represent the trajectoreis data from experiments, behavioral model, social force model, velocity obstacle model. 

The labels for the source trajectoires data are index, time-step, x-coordinate (m), y-coordinate (m), respectively.
